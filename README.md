Plant life cellular automata. Its design priority is for the entire system to have a constant amount of nutrients, which diffuse into plant cells, which then with the help of photosynthesis are converted into energised form. Later, when used by plant tissues to keep themselves alive, energy converts to waste, and then back into nutrients in the soil. In this simple simulation plant cell structure is also made of nutrients.
